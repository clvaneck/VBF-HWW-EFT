Description:

In this analysis, the different observables computed are pT_ll, M_T, m_WW, m_ll, V_x, DEta_ll, DPhi_ll, DR_ll, jet_pt, jet_eta, jet_phi.
It was developed by Sacha Mugnier with a C++ code which is in the same folder.
If you create your own analysis, you must put everything in the same file and be consistent with the name you choose.
I've kept the name MY_ANALYSIS in all of the files to avoid any troubles with the Rivet code.
For the observables pT_ll, M_T, m_WW, m_ll, V_x, jet_pt, jet_eta, jet_phi, I have used 40 bins,
for the others (DEta_ll, DPhi_ll, DR_ll), 20 bins have been used.

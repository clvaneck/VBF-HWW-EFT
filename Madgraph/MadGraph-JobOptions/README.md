This file gives a description of all the DSIDs (number that is a reference to a particular process) of the processes I've generated.

Syntax precision in the job option:
- NP=2: generateSM and both linear and quadratic EFT
- NP=1: generate SM with linear EFT terms
- NP^2==2: generation of only linear EFT terms
- NP^2==4: generation of only quadratic EFT terms
